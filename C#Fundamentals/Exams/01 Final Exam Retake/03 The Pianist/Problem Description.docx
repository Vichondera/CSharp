You are a pianist, and you like to keep a list of your favorite piano pieces. 
Create a program to help you organize it and add, change, remove pieces from it!
On the first line of the standard input, 
you will receive an integer n – the number of pieces you will initially have. 
On the next n lines, the pieces themselves will follow with their composer and key,
separated by "|" in the following format: "{piece}|{composer}|{key}".

Then, you will be receiving different commands, each on a new line,
separated by "|", until the "Stop" command is given:

    • "Add|{piece}|{composer}|{key}":
        ◦ You need to add the given piece with the information about it to the other pieces and print:
"{piece} by {composer} in {key} added to the collection!"
        ◦ If the piece is already in the collection, print:
"{piece} is already in the collection!"

    • "Remove|{piece}":
        ◦ If the piece is in the collection, remove it and print:
"Successfully removed {piece}!"
        ◦ Otherwise, print:
"Invalid operation! {piece} does not exist in the collection."

    • "ChangeKey|{piece}|{new key}":
        ◦ If the piece is in the collection, change its key with the given one and print:
"Changed the key of {piece} to {new key}!"
        ◦ Otherwise, print:
"Invalid operation! {piece} does not exist in the collection."

Upon receiving the "Stop" command, you need to print all pieces in your collection,
sorted by their name and by the name of their composer in alphabetical order, in the following format:
"{Piece} -> Composer: {composer}, Key: {key}"

Input/Constraints
    • You will receive a single integer at first – the initial number of pieces in the collection
    • For each piece, you will receive a single line of text with information about it.
    • Then you will receive multiple commands in the way described above until the command "Stop".
Output
    • All the output messages with the appropriate formats are described in the problem description.
